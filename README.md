# BLOCKS-SHOOTING-GAME
This repository contains a simple shooting game created as a practice project. The goal is to experiment with basic game development concepts such as player movement, shooting mechanics, scoring, and tracking a high score. Itâ€™s meant for learning and improving programming skills, not as a polished or professional release.
